Determining the accurate resale value of used vehicles is a persistent challenge, especially when traditional platforms rely only on basic tabular data such as brand, model, and mileage, while overlooking the physical condition of the car. However, surface-level damage like dents or scratches significantly impacts a car’s market value. Manually inspecting every listing is slow, subjective, and not scalable. To address this, AutoWorth introduces a fully automated, AI-powered car resale estimation system that fuses visual and numerical intelligence.

The system utilizes deep learning and machine learning techniques to create a comprehensive multimodal valuation pipeline. Specifically, it uses EfficientNet, a pre-trained convolutional neural network, to classify car damage from four directional images—front, back, left, and right—into Scratch, Dent, or No Damage. These visual insights are quantified into severity scores and combined with structured tabular inputs such as brand, fuel type, year, and kilometers driven. An XGBoost regressor is then used to accurately predict the car’s resale price based on this integrated dataset.

AutoWorth demonstrates how multimodal learning can eliminate subjectivity and increase pricing transparency in online vehicle marketplaces. With a clean web interface and real-time prediction capabilities, this system provides users a fast, fair, and data-driven second opinion—bridging the gap between traditional static listings and intelligent condition-aware pricing.
